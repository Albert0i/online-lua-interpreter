#### Prologue
I was looking for a good quick start guide on programming in Lua under Redis and turns out I have to write one by myself... 

> Lua [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) for control structures was mostly borrowed from [Modula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula) (`if`, `while`, `repeat/until`), but also had taken influence from [CLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLU_(programming_language)) (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to [reference parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_reference) or explicit [pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming))), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) ("neat idea of allowing a [local variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_variable) to be declared only where we need it"[[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua#cite_note-hopl2007-6)]), [SNOBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL) and [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) ([associative arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)). 

> In an article published in [Dr. Dobb's Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dobb%27s_Journal), Lua's creators also state that LISP and Scheme with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type))) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua.[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua#cite_note-ddj96-8)]

> Lua [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time,[[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua#cite_note-hopl2007-6)] especially with the introduction of [anonymous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function) and full [lexical scoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope_vs._dynamic_scope). Several features were added in new Lua versions.

More on [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua). 

> Scripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine. Presently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter. Please refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/programmability/lua-api/) page for complete documentation.
