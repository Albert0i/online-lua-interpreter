#### Prologue
> Scripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine. Presently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter. Please refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/programmability/lua-api/) page for complete documentation. 
More on [Scripting with Lua](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/programmability/eval-intro/). 


I was looking for a good quick start guide on programming in Lua under Redis and turns out I have to write one by myself...
